Do not change data source, so only Smollm dataset.
Do not make model a lot bigger or train a lot longer, each experiment should take 2 to 10 minutes on 1x4090.
Plan your goals and questions you want to answer with the experiment.
Plan how you will implement fairness of the experiment.
Print into console total number of experiments at the beginning.
Output all experiment outputs into conosle, try not to draw images or generate files by experiments, just write in console.

Ultimate goal:
2x baselinen performance
But you need to look for incremental improvements.
